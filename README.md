# H755_LedBlink NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q LED Blink Example
This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using the NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q microcontroller.
The LEDs are toggled when the user button (blue) is pressed. Additionally, a welcome message is sent to the ST-Link Virtual COM Port.

## Prerequisites

- NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q development board
- USB cable for programming and power
- STM32CubeIDE 
- Basic understanding of STM32 programming
